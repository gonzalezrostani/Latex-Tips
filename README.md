Hi! This repo is just a brief guide for beginners in LaTeX. I hope you enjoy it. I am sharing the link to the [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rrdfvjbpfyrq
) so you can see both the pdf and the main.txt. Also, in the pdf, you can see code that I include using verbatim. In the repo you can find the files that I used in case you want to reproduce it.

**Tip 1: Have fun learning LaTeX!**
