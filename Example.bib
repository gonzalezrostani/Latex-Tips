	abstract = {A prominent line of research on electoral systems and income redistribution argues that PR leads to tax and transfer policies that benefit the poor at the expense of the rich. This is because PR produces encompassing center-left coalitions that protect the poor and middle classes. Two facts that are inconsistent with this expectation are that countries with PR electoral systems tend to rely heavily on consumption taxes and tax profits lightly. Both policies are regressive and seem to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor. I argue that PR electoral institutions are not as hostile to the rich as commonly believed and that we need to understand how electoral systems interact with labor market institutions to explain the puzzling pattern of taxation that we observe. Empirical analysis supports the theoretical model and shows that the relationships between electoral institutions and tax policies hold when controlling for potential confounds.

(The main difference between this version (2.0) and the earlier version is that I argue work on income redistribution should consider both relative and absolute concepts and measures of inequality. Political inequality, in particular, is likely linked to absolute income inequality, and this is where taxes have their largest effect.)},

	abstract = {This article takes a closer look at the relationship between democracy and transnational terrorism. It investigates what it is about democracies that make them particularly vulnerable to terrorism from abroad. The authors suggest that states that exhibit a certain type of foreign policy behavior, regardless of their regime type, are likely to attract transnational terrorism. States that are actively involved in international politics are likely to create resentment abroad and hence more likely to be the target of transnational terrorism than are states that pursue a more isolationist foreign policy. Democratic states are more likely to be targeted by transnational terrorist groups not because of their regime type per se but because of the type of foreign policy they tend to pursue. The empirical analysis provides support for the argument.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that democratizing states are prone to civil wars. However, not all democratizing states experience domestic political violence. We argue that one of the key factors that “shelters” some democratizing states from domestic political violence is the receipt of democracy aid. Democratizing states that receive high levels of democracy assistance are less likely to experience civil conflict than countries that receive little or no external democracy assistance. During democratic transitions, the central authority weakens and uncertainty about future political commitments and promises among domestic groups increases. Democracy aid decreases the risk of conflict by reducing commitment problems and uncertainty. Using an instrumental variables approach that accounts for potential endogeneity problems in aid allocation, we find empirical support for our argument. We conclude that there is a potential path to democracy that ameliorates the perils of democratization, and democracy assistance programs can play a significant positive role in this process.},
